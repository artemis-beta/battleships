# Python Battleships

To launch the little game simply run:

`python battleships/__init__.py`

you will be asked to give coordinates in two stages, firstly the letter for the column 'A-J' and secondly the number of the row
'1-10'. You have 20 turns to destroy all the ships! Good luck! If this is too short a game feel free to change the `turns`variable in the code to a higher number.
